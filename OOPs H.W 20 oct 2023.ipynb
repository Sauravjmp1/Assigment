    "The main goals of OOP can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Modularity: OOP allows you to break down a complex system into smaller, more manageable parts or modules (objects). Each object encapsulates its data and functionality, making it easier to understand, maintain, and extend the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reusability: Objects and classes can be reused in different parts of a program or even in different programs. This reusability reduces redundancy and development time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes based on existing classes. This promotes code reuse and the establishment of hierarchical relationships between classes. Subclasses can inherit attributes and methods from their parent classes and then extend or override them as needed."

    "In Python, an object is a fundamental concept that represents a specific instance of a data structure or class.

    "Instances of Classes: In Python, objects are instances of classes. A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects. When you create an object, you are creating an instance of a specific class.\n",
